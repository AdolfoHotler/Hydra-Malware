# Hydra-Malware
The classic hydra virus from windows93.net. "Cut one head off, two more will take it's place"

Please use this application with caution! the only way to kill it is by shutting down your computer. 
(Task Manager might work but i don't know since i made this on my school computer and they have Task Manager disabled). 
Have fun with screwing with your friends or whatever you plan to use this for!
